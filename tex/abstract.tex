The implementation of services and micro services for distributed systems applications has been gaining ground in the choice of software architects for the application and definition of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), due to the easy implementation that provides modularity and flexibility development. In the Information Technology Center (CPD) of the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB), it appears as a proposal for the modernization of existing systems, maintained and managed by CPD, these systems have great strategic visibility and are key parts for the application and automation of UnB processes, for these reasons are widely used. The systems present some characteristics of legacy systems such as technological lag and lack of documentation, for these reasons, the importance of the modernization of these systems is seen. The proposal adopted by the CPD is the development of \ textit {web services} to modernize the systems in a modular way, raising, defining and prioritizing the services or micro services, in order to provide \ textit {web services} capable of replacing some functionalities of the systems have a number of functionalities, and so many web services have been developed and due to architectural flexibility many other web services will probably be developed. However, it appears as a problem due to the large number of \ textit {web services} developed, the management and monitoring of these \ textit {web services}. The aim of this work is to investigate solutions and tools for the implementation of Monitoring of distributed systems using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), with the intention of monitoring the operation of web services to allow monitoring, such as the number of requests and their availability.
